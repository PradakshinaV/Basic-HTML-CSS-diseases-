             </ul><br>
             <li><b>Non-Infectious Diseases:</b><br> Not caused by pathogens, often linked to genetics, lifestyle, or environment. Examples:</li>
             <ul>
                <li>Chronic Diseases: Diabetes, hypertension.</li>
                <li>Genetic Disorders: Down syndrome, sickle cell anemia.</li>
